Task:
Create a downloadable HTML file that uses D3.js to visualize data from the following CSV file:
https://adithyaajith-j.github.io/FDTMP_WebAPP/ChartData/FDTMP_Population_Statewide.csv

Requirements:

1. Axes:
	X-axis shows 2000, 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050 at 13px font.
	Y-axis is not rendered (no ticks or axis line).

2. Chart Style:
	Transparent background throughout.
	Two lines (Fort Worth, Statewide), both #196533
	Fort Worth line: 6px
	Statewide: 2px
	Solid from 2000–2024 and dotted from 2024–2050 (split into two paths per series).

3. Legend:
	Minimal legend inside the plot area (top-left), showing line thickness and color only (no mention of dotted projections).

4. Markers:
	White circles with green outline at 2000, 2010, 2020, 2024, 2030, 2040, 2050 for both lines.

5. Interactivity:
	Tooltip on hover/touch shows both series values for the nearest marker year, with thickness cues for clarity.

6. Reference Line:
	Dotted vertical line at 2024.
	The line starts at the x-axis and end at 2024 highest 2024 value.

7. Data Labels:
	Labels at 2000, 2024, 2050:
		Fort Worth: white text inside a #196533 box, centered over the marker (above the line).
		Statewide: bold #196533 text (with a subtle halo for contrast), placed above.
	Label placement clamps within the plot area, with generous top margin to prevent clipping.

8. Growth Labels:
	Percentage growth for 2000–2024 and 2024–2050, computed from the line values (linear interpolation if needed), placed above the line at the midpoint year for each range.
	Add a arrow below the label to show the direction of growth. The arrow need to be at angle that represenst the growth rate.

9. General:
	Uses the font IBM Plex Sans
	Responsive and avoids clipping via larger top margin and label clamping.
	Use the attached image as a reference.
