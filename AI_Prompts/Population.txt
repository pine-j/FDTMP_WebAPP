3. The Fort Worth line need to be thicker than Statewide line. Use this color for both: #196533
4. The ploted line from 2000 to 2024 needs to be solid line and 2024 to 2050 needs to be dotted for both Fort Worth and Statewide.
5. Add interactive Tooltip element on hover/touch to show the data values.
